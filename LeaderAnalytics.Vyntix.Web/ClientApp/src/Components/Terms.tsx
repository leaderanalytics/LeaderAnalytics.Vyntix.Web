                </p>
                <p>
                    The Vytix service is a collection of web and desktop components that allow Users to acquire economic and financial data, 
                    format it, and use it to build models for forecasting.  The service also allows the User to store and retrieve forecasts and tie tham back to 
                    the model that was used to generate them.
                </p>

                    2. Vyntix Accounts
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Vyntix account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. 
                    We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Vyntix account on behalf of a company, 
                    organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized 
                    representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  
                    You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” 
                    passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. 
                    You may not allow any other party to access or use the Service with your unique username, password, or other security code. 
                    You must notify Leader Analytics immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Leader Analytics will not be liable 
                    for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your account. 
                    By providing Leader Analytics your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any 
                    notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, 
                    such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out 
                    or change your preferences in your settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leader Analytics usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis and may not be offered for sale, sold, bought, solicited, or 
                    inactively held for future use. Inactive accounts may be renamed at any time without notification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you create a Vyntix account, you have to provide us with accurate information. You are responsible for any activity that occurs on your account, so make sure you have a strong password.
                    Your Vyntix account is your unique identity. Don’t let anyone else use your account.
                    You can control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by adjusting your account settings. 
                    We might email you important messages and information we think you’ll find useful. We will stop sending you promotional materials if you tell us you’re not interested.

                    We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; 
                    or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access 
                    to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this 
                    Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement. If your account is 
                    terminated for any reason, you must obtain written authorization from Leader Analytics prior to establishing another account. If you attempt 
                    to establish another account without obtaining such authorization, Leader Analytics may permanently ban you from the Service. You may not 
                    have more than one active account at any time without the written consent of Leader Analytics in each instance.

                <p>
                    You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Leader Analytics Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor

                </p>
                <p>
                    Leader Analytics does not support and will not tolerate its Service being used to discriminate against others, 
                    especially when based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin. 
                    You are not permitted to use the Service in a manner which would or would likely incite, promote or support such discrimination 
                    and you must not use the Service to incite or promote hostility or violence. If we believe in our sole determination that your use 
                    of the Service is being used to discriminate, especially if based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, 
                    ancestry or national origin, we may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason.

                    the Service without compensation “User Content”). 
                </p>

                        <li>(5) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, 
                        invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, hostile, violent,
                            or that which provokes violence or hostility, profane, or otherwise objectionable; </li> 
                        <li>(6) contains any information which discriminates against others based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin;</li>

                    </ul>    
                    You agree that any User Content does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights 
                    (as defined below) or rights of privacy or publicity. Leader Analytics reserves the right, but is not obligated, 
                    to reject and/or remove any User Content that Leader Analytics believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. 
                    You understand that publishing your User Content on or via the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office or some other rights organization. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Your User Content and Leader Analytics’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any 
                    rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy and publicity rights.
                    Leader Analytics may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any residuals, 
                    payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.
                    There is no suit action or claim or other legal or administrative proceeding now pending or threatened which might directly or indirectly 
                    affect any of your User Content or which might in any way impair the rights granted by you hereunder.
                    Your User Content is neither obscene, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
                    To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.
                    You will not transmit unsolicited emails or engage in spamming to publicize or promote your relationship with Leader Analytics.
                    If you use the Service to post, publish or print User Content, you agree that you have verified that the User Content does not contain anything that is 
                    illegal, infringes (or is otherwise deceptively similar to) any third-party’s Intellectual Property Rights, or otherwise breaches these terms.
                    You will not engage in pay per click advertising using keywords which compete with Leader Analytics’s own campaigns in order to promote your relationship with 
                    Leader Analytics nor will you use or engage a third party on your behalf to use Leader Analytics in any domain name.
                    Upon making or learning of any claim that is inconsistent with any of the representations or warranties made by you, Leader Analytics shall send you 
                    written notice of such claim, using the email address provided by you to Leader Analytics, specifying the details of the claim as then known to Leader Analytics. 
                    Pending the determination of such claim, Leader Analytics may withhold from royalties and/or other compensation due to you hereunder, such sums as are reasonably 
                    related to the probable value of the claim as determined by Leader Analytics.

                <p>
                    Leader Analytics takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User

                    publishing and printing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. 
                    You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or 
                    otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Leader Analytics shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a 
                    result of User Content or your use of it. In the event that your User Content is alleged to be offensive, inappropriate for children, unlawful or 
                    otherwise in breach of these terms, you agree that Leader Analytics may remove your User Content from the Service and disclose such User Content to

                    third party through the Leader Analytics service or any hyperlinked website or service, and Leader Analytics will not be a party to or in 
                    any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.

                    17. Limitation of Liability
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Leader Analytics, its affiliates, agents, directors, owners, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable 
                    for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, 
                    use, data or other intangible losses, that result from the use of, or inability to use, this service, including without limitation, User Content or data. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    Under no circumstances will Leader Analytics be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or 
                    use of the service or your account or the information contained therein.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Leader Analytics assumes no liability or responsibility for any 
                    <ul>
                        <li>(1) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; </li>
                        <li>(2) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; </li>
                        <li>(3) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein;</li> 
                        <li>(4) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the service; </li>
                        <li>(5) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; </li>
                        <li>(6) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or 
                        otherwise made available through the service; and/or</li> 
                        <li>(7) user content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. </li>
                    </ul>
                    In no event shall Leader Analytics, its affiliates, agents, owners, directors, employees, 
                    suppliers, or licensors be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to 
                    Leader Analytics hereunder or $100.00, whichever is greater.  No action, regardless of form or nature, arising out of this agreement may be brought by or on behalf of 
                    you more than one (1) year after the cause of action first arose.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Leader Analytics shall not be liable 
                    for any damages, costs or losses arising as a result of modifications made to User Content, data, or other content, or the context in which the User Content or other 
                    content is used by you.  This limitation of liability 
                    section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Leader Analytics has 
                    been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.
                    Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, 
                    so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary 
                    from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
                    The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Leader Analytics makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available 
                    for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with 
                    all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you 
                    are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. 
                    Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.
                    We disclaim all liability in connection with your use of the Service. To the extent we are found liable for anything, the maximum we are obligated to pay is 
                    the greater of $100.00 or however much you paid to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    18. Governing Law
                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree that: 
                    (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and 
                    (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Leader Analytics, either specific or general, in jurisdictions 
                    other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. 
                    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
                    You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Diego County, California for any actions for which we retain 
                    the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or 
                    violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a consumer, this agreement does not exclude any rights you may have under the national consumer laws of your jurisdiction.
                    These terms are governed by the laws of California but don’t exclude your rights under national consumer law. If we need to enforce our Intellectual Property Rights 
                    against you, you agree to have the issue resolved only in the courts of San Diego County, California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    19. Arbitration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any dispute with Leader Analytics, you agree to first contact us at our support email address and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. 
                    In the unlikely event that Leader Analytics has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to 
                    resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Leader Analytics claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or 
                    relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the 
                    American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes 
                    then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in San Diego County, California, unless you and Leader Analytics 
                    agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. 
                    The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other 
                    witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Nothing in this Section shall 
                    prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, 
                    misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. All claims must be brought in the 
                    parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, 
                    the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Leader Analytics are 
                    each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
                </p>

                    This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Leader Analytics without restriction. 
                    Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

                    Leader Analytics may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, 
                    to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Leader Analytics in our sole discretion. 
                    Leader Analytics reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of 
                    notification as described in this Agreement. Leader Analytics is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply 
                    to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Leader Analytics may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement 
                    from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update 
                    the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. 
                    If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy, any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Leader Analytics in connection with the Service, 
                    shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Leader Analytics concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of 
                    competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

                    20.4 No Waiver.

                <p>
                    No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Leader Analytics’s failure to assert 
                    any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
